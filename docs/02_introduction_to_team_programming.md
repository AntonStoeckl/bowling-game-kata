# What is team programming and why should we do it?

We try to use the term *team programming* instead of the original term mob programming, because we think that mob has a negative connotation
that enforces existing negative biases against its idea!
The term is however not crucial and can be understood as a synonym to the terms mob programming or ensemble programming.*

The technique itself has been around for some time and also does not have a single origin or creator.

However Woody Zuill can be considered as the spokesperson and also does a very good job of explaining its idea and concepts.
So instead of trying it our definition, we let Woody talk.

## Key ideas
>All the brilliant minds working on the same thing, at the same time, at the same (virtual) space, at the same computer.

>For an idea to go from someone's head to into the computer it must go through somebody else's hands. 
 
*Why people do it:*
- knowledge sharing
- flow and focus
- many perspectives
- rapid continuous feedback
- better solutions
  
# Key technique driver/typist & navigator/advisor
We have covered what it is and why it seems desirable to work this way.
Here is one key technique that people have been using:

[driver & navigator](https://youtu.be/SHOVVnRB4h0?t=1166) from 19:26 till minute ~28:00

Some details on the roles:
- We use the name driver and typist as synonyms.
- The team discusses the problem, agrees on the next task, its solution, and instructs the typist.
- The typist should follow instructions and not act on their own. This balances the participation of all team members and reduces the dominance of strong characters.
- The typist may of course ask clarifying questions to understand the solution, or raise his opinion, but the main focus should be on putting the instructions into code.

- There are two variations on the technique: Strict and non-strict navigation style.
- In the strict style only the navigator is allowed to instruct the driver, the others take the role of advisors.
- In the normal navigation style, this is rule is more relaxed: All members may instruct the driver, but the navigator normally takes the lead.
- *We recommend to start with the so-called "strict mode" with a designated navigator as the default. But it is totally fine to use the non-strict mode or mix them.*
