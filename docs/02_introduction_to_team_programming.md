# What is team programming and why should we do it?

We use the term *team programming* instead of the original term mob programming, because we think that mob has a negative connotation
that enforces existing negative biases against its idea!
However the term is not crucial and can be understood as a synonym to the terms mob programming or ensemble programming.*

The technique itself has been around for some time and also does not have a single origin or creator.

However Woody Zuill can be considered as somewhat of the spokesperson for mob programming and also does a very good job of explaining its idea and concepts.
So instead of trying it our definition, we let Woody talk.

## Key ideas
>All the brilliant minds working on the same thing, at the same time, at the same space, at the same computer.

>For an idea to go from someone's head to into the computer it must go through somebody else's hands. 
 
*Why people do it:*
- knowledge sharing
- flow and focus
- many perspectives
- rapid continuous feedback
- better solutions
  
# Key technique driver & navigator
We have covered what it is and why it seems desirable to work this way.
Here is one key technique on how people have been doing it:

More details on the roles needed? here or in recommendations?:
The typist must not code on their own. This balances the participation of all team members and it reduces the dominance of strong characters.
- The rest of the mob discusses the problem, agrees on the solution, and instructs the typist.
- The typist follows their instructions, puts them into code, and may ask clarifying questions to understand the solution.
- The rest of the mob guides the typist as needed.
- *We recommend to start with the so-called "strict mode" with a designated navigator as the default, the rest of the team acts as advisors. It is totally fine to use the non-strict mode without a designated navigator, or in other words, everybody except the typist is a navigator.*

*We value the typist as they allow the rest of the mob to focus on solving the problem.*
