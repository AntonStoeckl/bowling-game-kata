# TODOs to get the training ready
* prepare content for introduction and team-programming theory + techniques
* prepare feedback session
* prepare highlights


# Goal of our training
* group-size? recommended  4-6 members per team, one facilitator from us in each team

* how are groups formed?
  * probably no requirements from our side
  * whatever works

* Which choices do we allow? Which constraints are fixed?
* remote
  * minimum-team size: 3
  * initially java is set
  * in the future we might offer variants, or allow the teams to choose their language


* teach team-programming-techniques (mob/ensemble/pair-programming)
* should we incorporate tdd?
  * we encourage it, but do not require them to work in a specific way
  * encourage by explain how it works well together with team-programming
* not that the bowling game is implemented fully and correctly

* extension points


* measure the results ?
  * simply provide place for feedback at the end
  * how?
    * execute testsuite and track success / failure
  * survey about quality, methods used etc.
    * menti-meter?
  * within the training or outside


# TODOs

* Introduction -> **Basti**
* Reset tests in branch, so we have only a first, failing test and save full test suite into a branch -> **Laurens**
* Setup documentation, screenshots -> **Basti**
* Prepare feedback "questionaire" -> **Basti**
* Send email (please check out, install, ...) (on the day before the workshop)

---------------------------------------------------------

## What will you learn?

* What are the advantages of team programming?
* How to run a team programming session!
* What are the roles in team programming and how should they behave?
* How to do handovers when the roles are switched!
* Optional: Test-Driven Development


## What problem will we solve (implement)?

We will solve the Bowling Game Kata together - with Java. Basic Java skills will be sufficient. The team can support participants that are not fluid in Java yet.

## How will we work in this workshop?

The participants will be split into teams (ensembles) of ideally 4-6 developers and will solve the Kata as far as we can get.
All teams are encouraged, but not forced, to work in a strict TDD style. We will switch roles every 15 minutes.



# Some decisions to make

* Decide rotation time (we recommend 15m)
* Decide if you want to do TDD (we recommend so)
* Pick first typist and navigator
* Navigator + advisors: What to start with? (e.g. first test case)
